# ETAF Markdown Preview manual

This manual covers the workflows a reader performs. The root entry's
Commentary owns the supported API inventory; this document links to it instead
of repeating signatures.

## Keys

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `n` / `p` | Move to the next / previous heading of the document |
| `TAB` | Choose a heading from a completion list |
| `RET`, mouse-1 | Activate the link, image or video under point |
| `r` | Re-read the file and repaint |
| `t` | Cycle the palette (dark, light, sepia) |
| `[` / `]` | Narrow / widen the maximum reading measure by four columns |
| `?` | Show a one-line key summary |
| `q` | Unmount the preview and kill its buffer |
| `C-s`, `C-v`, `M-v`, wheel | Native isearch and scrolling |

The buffer is an ordinary Emacs buffer, so isearch, `occur`, window splitting,
`C-x C-s`-style buffer handling and `imenu` all keep working. `M-x imenu`
lists the document outline.

## Supported Markdown

The parser covers CommonMark blocks and inlines plus the GitHub extensions a
preview needs:

- Headings: ATX (`#` … `######`) and Setext (`===`, `---`), with stable
  anchors used by tables of contents and `#fragment` links.
- Paragraphs with emphasis, strong emphasis, strikethrough, inline code,
  links (inline, reference and shortcut), autolinks and raw inline HTML
  (rendered literally).
- Fenced code blocks with an info string (shown as a language tag) and
  indented code blocks; long lines wrap so no code is hidden.
- Blockquotes, nested ordered and unordered lists, and task list items
  (`- [x]`, `- [ ]`).
- Pipe tables with left, center and right alignment, drawn as a full grid
  with an outer frame, row and column separators and a header rule.
- GitHub alerts (`> [!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]`,
  `[!CAUTION]`) rendered as titled callout blocks.
- Thematic breaks, character references, backslash escapes and hard line
  breaks.
- Footnotes: `[^label]` references render numbered and definitions collect at
  the end of the document; activating a reference jumps to its definition.
- YAML front matter is removed from the body; its `title` becomes the document
  title and its author, date, version, license and status keys render in a
  title area at the top of the document.

`etaf-md-preview-create` selects the dialect with its `:flavor` argument:
`gfm` (the default) enables the GitHub extensions and front matter,
`commonmark` parses the core specification only, and a feature plist such as
`(:tables t :task-lists nil)` toggles individual extensions.

Image syntax and HTML `<img>` / `<video>` tags render as media cards. Relative paths resolve against the document's directory. A local image
renders through ETAF's image Host; a local video renders a poster frame and a
play caption. Activate either the video poster or its caption with RET to open
it in the operating system's default player. Playback happens in that player,
not inside the Emacs poster; use the player's play control if it opens paused.
Remote images render a labeled placeholder whose activation
opens the URL. A missing or unreadable file renders a placeholder card, never
an error.

## Theming and layout

`etaf-md-preview-theme` chooses the document's colors. The default `auto`
derives them from the active frame's own faces: the page keeps the Emacs
theme's background, muted text follows `shadow`, headings `outline-1`, links
`link`, callouts `success`/`warning`/`error`, and panel surfaces (code blocks,
table headers and stripes, rules) are small blends of the frame's background
toward its foreground. The preview therefore matches whatever Emacs theme is
active without painting a page background of its own. The fixed `dark`,
`light` and `sepia` palettes remain available when a self-contained page is
wanted: selecting one paints its page background. `t` cycles the fixed
palettes, `etaf-md-preview-set-theme` pins one, and the resulting colors are
published as `:ui-*` theme tokens, so shared ETAF UI components used inside
the preview follow them.

The reading measure is capped and centered in the window. The session stores a
maximum; the column stretches to the window and never exceeds it, so a narrow
window fills the available columns. `[` and `]` adjust the maximum manually in
both directions, and the result is clamped between `etaf-md-preview-width-min`
and `etaf-md-preview-width-max`. A window resize reflows through the renderer's
viewport update rather than rebuilding the document, and because the preview
publishes into one buffer, resizing never restarts the session.

## Customization

Four options cover the supported personalization; every other appearance
decision follows the document and the frame.

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `etaf-md-preview-theme` | `auto` | Initial palette; `auto` derives the colors from the Emacs theme's faces and paints no page background. |
| `etaf-md-preview-flavor` | `gfm` | Default Markdown dialect when `etaf-md-preview-create` gets no `:flavor`. |
| `etaf-md-preview-width-min` | `40` | Narrowest reading measure, in character cells. |
| `etaf-md-preview-width-max` | `110` | Widest reading measure; a wider window keeps it and centers the column. |

## Scripting and headless use

`etaf-md-preview-create` builds a session from a file or from text without any
buffer; `etaf-md-preview-view` returns the mountable view; `etaf-md-preview-state`
reports a detached snapshot. A session created from text is a complete
headless preview, which is what the acceptance tests use:

```elisp
(let* ((session (etaf-md-preview-create :text "# Notes\n\n**bold** body.\n"))
       (buffer (etaf-md-preview-open session)))
  (etaf-md-preview-locate session 0)
  (etaf-md-preview-set-theme session 'sepia)
  (etaf-md-preview-refresh session)
  (with-current-buffer buffer (etaf-md-preview-close)))
```

`etaf-md-preview-open` accepts a file path or a session, so callers can render
a document they built themselves. `etaf-md-preview-locate` moves point to an
outline index; `etaf-md-preview-outline` returns the outline itself.

`scripts/md-preview-gui-probe.el` drives a live frame for GUI verification: it
opens a document at a given frame size, reports one-line state, sends real
keys and checks layout invariants (no over-wide line, an interactive link, an
outline).

## Troubleshooting

- **A heading jump lands on the wrong occurrence.** Heading navigation finds
  the rendered heading text at the start of a buffer line, in outline order.
  Two headings with identical text are matched in order; an unusual document
  whose paragraph starts with the same text at line start may be matched
  first.
- **An image shows dots or a colored block grid.** The frame has no usable
  graphics support for that file, so Ebox fell back to its terminal
  converters; install ffmpeg for better terminal rendering, or view the file
  in a graphical frame.
- **A video shows a placeholder instead of a poster.** ffmpeg is not
  available on `exec-path`; the video still opens on activation.
- **Theme changes do not repaint shared components.** The preview publishes
  its palette for its own subtree only; a surrounding application keeps its
  own theme context.
